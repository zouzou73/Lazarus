**NOTE** For faster builds you can comment out the line `"postcompile": [ "node node_modules/webpack/bin/webpack.js --config webpack.config.vendor.js" ]` in the "`project.json`" file.
 This is only required for the first time build and when the vendor packages in the `webpack.config.vendor.js` file is modified.
